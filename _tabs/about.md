# Meet the Mind Behind the Machine

Hey, I’m Samuel, though around the web, you might know me as **iPsalmy OR DghostNinja** 🥷🏼.

I’m a curious engineer with a passion for **breaking, building, and understanding the invisible architecture of the digital world**. Whether it’s reverse engineering an app, crafting tools for automation, or finding clever ways to stress-test security boundaries, I love to get my hands dirty with code and systems that run on 0s and 1s.

This site is a glimpse into my experiments, side projects, security research, and the lessons I learn along the way. I’m constantly exploring new stacks, tweaking workflows, and sharing tools that I hope will help others too.

If you're into **Application Security, Security Research or just love seeing how stuff works under the hood**, you're in the right place.

Let’s build, break, and learn together.
