# Building a Secure CI/CD Pipeline for a Python App: From Code to Render Deployment

Modern web development isn't just about building cool apps, it's about building secure, automated, and production-ready systems. In this post, we walk through how I built, secured, and deployed a Python-based web application with an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using GitLab, Render, and industry-standard security tools like Semgrep, Bandit, Trivy, and Snyk.

Whether youâ€™re a DevOps enthusiast or a security conscious developer, this guide will show you how to shift security left, streamline deployment, and automate reporting, all in one place
