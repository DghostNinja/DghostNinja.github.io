# Installing Burpsuite pro ‚Äî Cracked Edition (‚ö†Ô∏èWarning! At your own risk)

Not everyone can affrod paying for the pro edition of Burpsuite and the Community edition is limited with certain things like extensions, backup, fast bruteforce on intruder and so on.

Some group of hackers have a cracked(moded) version of this tool in closed circulation, which if you ask me is not really ideal to use because of security reasons. 


## Installation guide
**I won't be adding the Burp file and screenshots for security reasons**

- Optional
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

- Get the pro file installed, cd into the folder and run 
```bash
java -jar burploader.jar
``` 

- Click on auto run or manual activation process once the burp license verification interface pops up. Best bet is use auto run and copy the license key from the popup window.

- Follow the instructions displayed strictly, once the burpsiute pro interface launches.

- After installation and verification, add this script to
```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/burpsuite.desktop
``` 
+ This is to set the newly instled Burp-pro as icon launcher

```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=BurpSuite Pro
Comment=Start BurpSuite with BurpLoader without resetting the license
Exec=sh -c "cd /file_path_to_your_burp/burpsuite_pro_v2024.5 && /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/bin/java -jar burploader.jar"
Icon=/file_path_to_your_burp-pro_Pictures/burp.png
Terminal=false
Categories=Development;Security;
StartupWMClass=BurpSuite
```
*‚òùÔ∏èFor the above. Ensure you download an image icon for the burp (Icon part)*

- chmod the file to run as excutable
```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/burpsuite.desktop
```

- Copy to desktop 
```bash
cp ~/.local/share/applications/burpsuite.desktop ~/Desktop/
```

There you go! You have a Burp-pro launcher

### Run without an Icon launcher
If you prefer running straight from terminal without launcher. *cd* into the directory where your Burp-pro file is downloded and unzipped. Run this command like a Mr. Robot maniac everytime üôÇ 

```bash
java -jar burploader.jar
```


#### BONUS: Fixing JDK 21 issue with burp-pro
**Just incase you run into a java compatibility error with the burp-pro**

1. **Extract OpenJDK 21**  
   - Download java 21
     ```bash
     https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk21/fd2272bbf8e04c3dbaee13770090416c/35/GPL/openjdk-21_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
     ```
   - Run the following command to extract the archive:
     ```bash
     tar -xvzf openjdk-21_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
     ```
   - After extracting, check the extracted folder name by running `ls`.  
     It should display something like `jdk-21` or `jdk-21.0.2`.

2. **Move the Extracted Folder to /opt**  
   - Once you identify the correct extracted folder name (e.g., `jdk-21.0.2`), move it to `/opt`:
     ```bash
     sudo mv jdk-21.0.2 /opt/openjdk-21
     ```

3. **Verify the Files Are in Place**  
   - Check if Java is inside `/opt/openjdk-21/bin/`:
     ```bash
     ls -l /opt/openjdk-21/bin/java
     ```
   - If this returns a valid result, continue to the next step.  
     If not, ask one of them AI thingy.

4. **Add Java 21 to the Alternatives System**  
   - Register OpenJDK 21 in the alternatives system:
     ```bash
     sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/openjdk-21/bin/java 21
     ```
   - Then, select Java 21 as the default version:
     ```bash
     sudo update-alternatives --config java
     ```

5. **Verify Java Version**  
   - Run the following command to confirm that Java 21 is now active:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - Now try running Burp Suite again:
     ```bash
     java -jar burploader.jar
     ```

## Ending Note
However this is not the only alternative to use. You can try out [Caido](https://caido.io/) which will give you access to at most 3 plugins/extensions, backup and lot more features in the free edition. 

If you are a Burpsuite die hard fan, then it's either you get your noney up and pay for that professional license, or go the rogue ninja way with a touch of panic attack, just incase ..... a little spice of malware.üåö

Haappy hacking! ‚úåÔ∏è
