# HACKING A BANK API

[Ghost St Badmus](https://x.com/commando_skiipz?t=rPix1FAXa-vFamgkrxjjnQ&s=09), a cracked Snr. Application Security Engineer developed a vulnerable Web Application, API and Mobile Application for Pentesters, Bug Bounty Hunters and Security Researchers. To test their skills without messing up real world infrastructures.


In this write-up, I'll be exploiting the APIs in the web apllication version of the vulnerable lab, as a complement to my completed course from [APISEC University](https://university.apisec.ai/)

## Setup
First thing we are doing is reverse engineering the API so we can work on it on Postman. Navigate to the **openapi.yaml** on the github repo, copy the JSON and paste into [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io)

- We have the swagger file imported into postman. Now, let's start hacking!

## BOLA (Broken Obeject Level Authorization)
Let's start with exploiting BOLA from the API endpoint.

As usual, register 2 accounts like we are testing for IDOR. Let's call them both Acount A and Account B respectively. On Postman, set your baseurl in the collection to **http://localhost:5000**. Login in.

To test an ID parameter or unique number, we are going to test the transfer API so we can have a transaction history on our dashboard. Log in into Account A and initiate a transfer to Account B.

We have new balnce since we removed **$100**
