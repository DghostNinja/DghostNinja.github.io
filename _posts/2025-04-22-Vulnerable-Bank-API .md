# HACKING A BANK API

[Ghost St Badmus](https://x.com/commando_skiipz?t=rPix1FAXa-vFamgkrxjjnQ&s=09), a cracked Snr. Application Security Engineer developed a vulnerable Web Application, API and Mobile Application for Pentesters, Bug Bounty Hunters and Security Researchers. To test their skills without messing up real world infrastructures.


In this write-up, I'll be exploiting the APIs in the web apllication version of the vulnerable bank lab, as complement and test for my recently completed course from [APISEC University](https://university.apisec.ai/)

## Setup
First thing we are doing is reverse engineering the API so we can work on it on Postman. Navigate to the **openapi.yaml** on the github repo, copy the JSON and paste into [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io)

- We have the swagger file imported into postman. Now, let's start hacking!

## API1:  BOLA (Broken Obeject Level Authorization)
BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) is a common and critical vulnerability that occurs when an API exposes object identifiers (like user IDs, account numbers, or transaction IDs) and fails to properly verify whether the currently authenticated user is authorized to access that object.



### Exploitation:
Let's start with exploiting BOLA from the API endpoint.

As usual, register 2 accounts like we are testing for IDOR. Let's call both Acount A and Account B respectively. On Postman, set your **baseurl** in the collection to **http://localhost:5000**. Login in.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A6.png)

To test an ID parameter or unique number, we are going to test the transfer API so we can have a transaction history on our dashboard. Log in into Account A and initiate a transfer to Account B.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A7.png)

We have new balnce since we removed **$100** 

Now, let's log in again as Account B and move to the transaction endpoint so we can view the transations of Account A.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A8.png)

- Switch the account number to that of Account A, which is **2121763565** in my case.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A9.png)

From the image above, we can notice we are able to view the transaction details of Account A while authenticated as Account B.

The API failed to enforce object-level authorization. It trusted that any user who sends a valid token could access any account's transactions, as long as they knew the account ID.

### Fix:
Always enforce user-level authorization on every API request:

- Verify the authenticated user's ID matches the target resource (e.g., user ID, account ID).

- Never rely on client-side input or assume users will only access their own data.

- Implement backend checks to ensure users can only access, modify, or delete their own resources.


## API2: Broken Authentication

Broken Authentication is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities in web and API security. It happens when an application fails to properly verify user identity or enforce authentication controls, allowing attackers to impersonate users or access protected resources.



### Exploitation:

To exploit this, we will be authenticated as Account B and request a password reset for Account A. We got a **Invalid Reset PIN**. Meaning, the Reset password API endpoint isn't verifying if we are authorized to carry out this action.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A10.png)

Let's proxy the request through web proxy (Burp/Caido), copy the 
reset password JSON parameter. Now, let's fuzz the PIN with *wfuzz*

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A11.png)

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A12.png)


Using the crafted command *wfuzz -d '{"username":"ipsalmy", "reset_pin":"FUZZ", "new_password":"Reset@1"}' -H 'Content-type: application/json' -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Fuzzing/3-digits-000-999.txt -u http://172.19.0.3:5000/api/v2/reset-password --hc 500* we were able to reset the password of Account A.


![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A13.png)

- Ensure you have Seclists wordlist installed before running this fuzz

When we try logging in into account A dashboard using the previous password we set while registering, we get an error. Try the new password we added while fzzing the endpoint and we have access to account A.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A15.png)

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A16.png)

The API endpoint didn't verify what we are able to do or not, so this enabled us to reset another user's password.
In a real scenario this would be a complete ATO - Acoount Take Over.

### Fix:
Implement a secure password reset flow with proper verification:

- Require a unique, time-bound reset token sent to the user's email.

- Only allow password reset after verifying the token.

- Never accept direct email + new password combinations without prior authentication or token verification.

- Add rate-limiting and logging to prevent brute-force attacks



## API3: (BOPLA (Broken Object Property Level Authorization)
Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA) is a lesser-known but dangerous API vulnerability where users can modify specific fields or properties of an object that they shouldn‚Äôt have access to, even if they‚Äôre allowed to access the object itself.


### Exploitation:
For this, I tried switchig the **is_admin": false** parameter from *true* to *false* but I wasn't gettting any admin privileges or seeing the admin dashboard. So, let's try another approach.

Let's register a new user(Account C) and give it admin privileges. We can do this by introudcing the **is_admin: true** into the API endpoint.

While trying this out, I almost gave up on it thinking it's not working, but I missed something out, comma (,) to separate the JSON request.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A19.png)

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A20.png)


We can confirm from both the webproxy and the dashboard that Account 3 has been registered as an admin.



### Fix:
- Whitelist allowed fields server-side

- Never trust the client to send safe data even during registration.

- Ignore or explicitly reject any unauthorized fields in the payload.

- For sensitive fields (like is_admin, role, etc.), set or manage them exclusively on the server, not through user input.



## API4:  Unrestricted Resource Consumption
This vulnerability occurs when an API allows clients to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, or database queries) without any limits or throttling, leading to performance issues, service degradation, or even denial of service (DoS).


### Exploitation:
From the Broken Authentication attack we performed earlier to be successful, it means the application is not restricting requests sent to server. Requests like unsuccessful login, forgot password, rest password and the likes. 

This renders the web application vulnerable to attacks like bruteforcing, no rate limit, password spraying and race condition.

### Fix:
- Rate Limiting:
Use tools (e.g., Nginx, API Gateways) to limit requests per user/IP.

- Pagination:
Enforce limit and offset with a max cap (e.g., limit=100).

- Timeouts & Resource Caps:
Set execution timeouts and memory limits for heavy operations.

- Authentication & Throttling:
Restrict high-resource actions to authenticated users with limits.

- Monitoring:
Track resource usage and set alerts for abnormal spikes.


## API5:  BFLA (Broken Function Level Authorization)
It's a security vulnerability where an application does not properly enforce authorization checks at the function or API endpoint level. This can allow a user to access or perform actions they shouldn‚Äôt be able to, based on their role or permissions.


### Exploitation:
To exploit this, register as a regular user, locate an admin endpoint from the swagger. Send and intercept the request through web proxy and try to perform actions only an admin is authorized to do.

I tried to delete account 1 without being the admin but this vulnerable bank seems not to be vulnerable to this. I also tried to request for a loan through account A and make account B approve the loan request, but still not vulnerable to this vulnerability. 


Hol'up! Don't scroll away yet. I found something.

There's a way aroud performing BFLA on this application. We can chain the Broken Authentication vulnerability with this one.

Let's go to jwt.io and change the *is_admin* in the JWT token from **false** to **true**. Navigate to the Delete user endpoint in postman. Copy and Paste the forged jwt iinto the Authorization tab.


![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A21.png)

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A22.png)


Add the user ID of account A into the request and send the request.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A23.png)

Boom! We've deleted account A by using account B.

+ **Bonus**: You can dig around to find and exploit more admin endpoint not properly verifying if you are admin or not, before you perform a specific action on the server

### Fix:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Ensure proper role validation for each function or API endpoint.

- Function-Level Authorization Checks:
Explicitly verify that the authenticated user has permission to access or perform actions on specific functions.

- Principle of Least Privilege:
Limit each user's access to only the functions and data necessary for their role.

- Centralized Authorization Logic:
Implement a consistent authorization layer (middleware or service) across all endpoints for easy management.

- Audit Logs:
Log and monitor all privileged function access to detect unauthorized attempts.
