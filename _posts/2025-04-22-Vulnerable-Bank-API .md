# HACKING API

In this write-up, I'll be exploiting the APIs in the web apllication version of the vulnerable lab, as a complement to my completed course from [APISEC University](https://university.apisec.ai/)

## Setup
First thing we are doing is reverse engineering the API so we can work on it on Postman. Navigate to the **openapi.yaml** on the github repo, copy the JSON and paste into [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io)

- We have the swagger file imported into postman. Now, let's start hacking!
