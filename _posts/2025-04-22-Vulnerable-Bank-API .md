# HACKING A BANK API

[Ghost St Badmus](https://x.com/commando_skiipz?t=rPix1FAXa-vFamgkrxjjnQ&s=09), a cracked Snr. Application Security Engineer developed a vulnerable Web Application, API and Mobile Application for Pentesters, Bug Bounty Hunters and Security Researchers. To test their skills without messing up real world infrastructures.


In this write-up, I'll be exploiting the APIs in the web apllication version of the vulnerable bank lab, as complement and test for my recently completed course from [APISEC University](https://university.apisec.ai/)

## Setup
First thing we are doing is reverse engineering the API so we can work on it on Postman. Navigate to the **openapi.yaml** on the github repo, copy the JSON and paste into [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io)

- We have the swagger file imported into postman. Now, let's start hacking!

## API1:  BOLA (Broken Obeject Level Authorization)
BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) is a common and critical vulnerability that occurs when an API exposes object identifiers (like user IDs, account numbers, or transaction IDs) and fails to properly verify whether the currently authenticated user is authorized to access that object.



### Exploitation:
Let's start with exploiting BOLA from the API endpoint.

As usual, register 2 accounts like we are testing for IDOR. Let's call both Acount A and Account B respectively. On Postman, set your **baseurl** in the collection to **http://localhost:5000**. Login in.

To test an ID parameter or unique number, we are going to test the transfer API so we can have a transaction history on our dashboard. Log in into Account A and initiate a transfer to Account B.

We have new balnce since we removed **$100** 

Now, let's log in again as Account B and move to the transaction endpoint so we can view the transations of Account A.

- Switch the account number to that of Account A, which is **2121763565** in my case.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A9.png)

From the image above, we can notice we are able to view the transaction details of Account A while authenticated as Account B.

The API failed to enforce object-level authorization. It trusted that any user who sends a valid token could access any account's transactions, as long as they knew the account ID.

### Fix:
Always enforce user-level authorization on every API request:

- Verify the authenticated user's ID matches the target resource (e.g., user ID, account ID).

- Never rely on client-side input or assume users will only access their own data.

- Implement backend checks to ensure users can only access, modify, or delete their own resources.


## API2: Broken Authentication

Broken Authentication is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities in web and API security. It happens when an application fails to properly verify user identity or enforce authentication controls ‚Äî allowing attackers to impersonate users or access protected resources.



### Exploitation:

To exploit this, we will be authenticated as Account B and request a password reset for Account A. We got a **Invalid Reset PIN**. Meaning, the Reset password API endpoint isn't verifying if we are authorized to carry out this action.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A10.png)

Let's proxy the request through web proxy (Burp/Caido), copy the 
reset password JSON parameter. Now, let's fuzz the PIN with *wfuzz*

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A11.png)

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A12.png)


Using the crafted command *wfuzz -d '{"username":"ipsalmy", "reset_pin":"FUZZ", "new_password":"Reset@1"}' -H 'Content-type: application/json' -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Fuzzing/3-digits-000-999.txt -u http://172.19.0.3:5000/api/v2/reset-password --hc 500* we were able to reset the password of Account A.


![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A13.png)

- Ensure you have Seclists wordlist installed before running this fuzz

When we try logging in into account A dashboard using the previous password we set while registering, we get an error. Try the new password we added while fzzing the endpoint and we have access to account A.

![alt](/assets/images/vuln-api/A16.png)

The API endpoint didn't verify what we are able to do or not, so this enabled us to reset another user's password.
In a real scenario this would be a complete ATO - Acoount Take Over.

### Fix:
Implement a secure password reset flow with proper verification:

- Require a unique, time-bound reset token sent to the user's email.

- Only allow password reset after verifying the token.

- Never accept direct email + new password combinations without prior authentication or token verification.

- Add rate-limiting and logging to prevent brute-force attacks
