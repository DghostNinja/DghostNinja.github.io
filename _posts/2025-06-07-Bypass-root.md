# Introduction
🧰 Tools: Frida, apk-mitm, Objection, Genymotion  
📱 Target App: (Redacted)

Mobile app developers often implement root/jailbreak and emulator detection to protect sensitive data, prevent tampering, or block automation. But like any client-side control, these mechanisms can be bypassed with the right knowledge and tools.

In this post, I’ll walk you through how I defeated both root and emulator detection mechanisms in a real-world Android application. I’ll cover how I bypassed the detection logic, the technical steps I took to disable it and also the rabbit holes I fell into. Whether you're a security researcher, reverse engineer, or just curious about mobile app internals, this post will give you a hands-on look at how these defenses work and how to get around them.

## The Solution
I generated a first [js code](https://github.com/DghostNinja/Application-Security/blob/main/APPSEC-notes%2FMobSec%2Fbypass-root-emulator.js) to hook with frida and the mobile app. 

```js
Java.perform(function () {
    var Build = Java.use("android.os.Build");
    var Debug = Java.use("android.os.Debug");

    // Bypass "Build.FINGERPRINT" and related emulator checks
    Build.FINGERPRINT.value = "samsung/SM-G975F";
    Build.MODEL.value = "SM-G975F";
    Build.MANUFACTURER.value = "samsung";
    Build.BRAND.value = "samsung";
    Build.DEVICE.value = "beyond1";
    Build.PRODUCT.value = "beyond1";

    // Bypass Debug checks
    Debug.isDebuggerConnected.implementation = function () {
        return false;
    };

    // Optional: Bypass common root file checks
    var File = Java.use("java.io.File");
    File.exists.implementation = function () {
        var name = this.getAbsolutePath();
        if (
            name.indexOf("su") !== -1 ||
            name.indexOf("busybox") !== -1 ||
            name.indexOf("magisk") !== -1
        ) {
            return false;
        }
        return this.exists();
    };

    console.log("[+] Root and emulator checks bypassed.");
});
```

This script was only able to bypass the root detection, but not tye emulator. This gave me the confidence to keep digging, since I got a step closer to my main goal.

I generated [a second](https://github.com/DghostNinja/Application-Security/blob/main/APPSEC-notes%2FMobSec%2Fbypass-root-%26-emulator-detection.js#L1-L117) and hook to the app with frida and voilà! I was able to get pass both the root and emulator check.

## Final thought 


# Bonus
I made a bash script to automate the process of installing and pushing the frida server into your andruod emulator easily. Figured out the manual process can sometimes be a little time taking, if one is running on schedule. 

All you have to do is download the right frida server for your andriod emulator from [Github](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/tag/17.1.2)

Link to the frida server setup can be found [here](https://github.com/DghostNinja/Application-Security/blob/main/APPSEC-notes%2FMobSec%2Ffrida_set.sh). All you have to do is grant permmission and run. 

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use MagiskHide with a proper DenyList for most basic root checks.

See you in the next write-up. Happy hacking!✌️
