# > Introduction

Mobile app developers often implement root/jailbreak and emulator detection to protect sensitive data, prevent tampering, or block automation. But like any client-side control, these mechanisms can be bypassed with the right knowledge and tools.

In this post, I’ll walk you through how I defeated both root and emulator detection mechanisms in a real-world Android application. I’ll cover how I bypassed the detection logic, the technical steps I took to disable it and also the rabbit holes I fell into. Whether you're a security researcher, reverse engineer, or just curious about mobile app internals, this post will give you a hands-on look at how these defenses work and how to get around them.

# Bonus
I made a bash script to automate the process of installing and pushing the frida server into your andruod emulator easily. Figured out the manual process can sometimes be a little time taking, if one is running on schedule.
